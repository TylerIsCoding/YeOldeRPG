<p>The Ye Olde RPG is the first larger project that I ever coded/pushed to GitHub. I learned a LOT about Python, OOP, ASCII art, and coding in general with this project.</p>
<h2>How It's Made</h2>
<p><strong>Tech Used:</strong> Python</p>
<br>
<p>
I built this terminal game with Python.

- I tried to create an interactive game that uses RPG mechanics found in popular computer games or tabletop games like Dungeons and Dragons.
- It has heavy influence from everything I was interested in at the time (Tarkov, stocks, Dogecoin, etc) and includes it somehow in the game.
- I created some serious ASCII art to accompany the simplistic gameplay.
- The game has a leveling system, health points, special moves, and inventory.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Optimizations</h2>
<p>Where to even begin... Like I've stated before; this was the first real application I ever made.

I could have:
- Not started this project over more than 4 times after I kept learning.
- Used classes and OOP from the start.
- Make it run in something other than the terminal.

</p>
<br>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>Building this game was a great learning experience and I took away several valuable lessons:
- This is where I learned what variables, functions, classes, etc. were.
- I learned all of my foundations of coding with this project.
- I learned object oriented programming with the Python language.
